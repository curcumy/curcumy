# Curcumy

## Business Goal

Curcumy is a project aiming at tackling the problem that crypto-investors face every day: monitoring their asset in a simple and inclusive way, also being  ready for their tax obligations.
CeFi, DeFi, Foreign accounts are all monitored from the perspective of investors (i.e. not traders).
              

## Technical target

Going through several phases, the project wants to provide an extensible portal where the users can access with their decentralized identity and collect the information about their positions. They will be able to generate reports for supporting their tax and finantial activities.

## Initial Phases

### Prototyping (V0.5)

The first phase is understanding the direction and the nature of the project from the technical point of view and will create a working prototype able to:

* manage the personal account
* manually import or edit positions and/or transactions
* show balances according different grouping
* calculate initial, final, maximum balances according different criteria

When possible, the prototype will be integrated with technological exploration modules (a.k.a. _pioneers_), providing busimess logic and web user interface.

### Minimum Technological Release (V1.0)

The prototype and pioneers will then start to migrate to a local complete enviroment, providing a minimum viable product.
During this phase, the technological prerequisites will be decided, still being open to further adjustments and evolutions.

### Consolidated Release (V1.1)

The technological release will be subject to tests and refactoring to become a stable product with as least as possible techniocal debt.
